This book is the result of a student projects for [Case Studies](https://github.com/mini-pw/2021L-WarsztatyBadawcze) course at the Warsaw University of Technology. Each team prepared an article on one of the topics selected from reproducibility, imputation, and interpretability.

This project is inspired by a book [Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning Methods](https://compstat-lmu.github.io/iml_methods_limitations/) created at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich [XAI Stories. Case studies for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence](https://pbiecek.github.io/xai_stories/) done at the Warsaw University of Technology and at the University of Warsaw, and [ML Case Studies](https://mini-pw.github.io/2020L-WB-Book/) during the last year's course.
We used the LIML project as the cornerstone for this repository.

<!-- Technical setup -->
## Technical Setup {-}
The book chapters are written in the Markdown language.
The simulations, data examples and visualizations were created with R [@rlang] and Python.
The book was compiled with the bookdown package.
We collaborated using git and github.
